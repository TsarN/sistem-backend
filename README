 To compile system one will need:
  - (Linux users) Patched Linux kernel (see ejudge.ru for sandbox patches)
  - (Windows users) CygWin or MinGW enviroment
  - C compiler
  - C++ compiler (for several tests)
  - GNU Make

 How to compile backend:
  - Compile system by typing "make"
  - Run tests by typing "make check"

 What to do if some tests don't pass:
  - (Linux users) Make sure that you are running on patched Linux kernel
  - (Windows users) I'll fix Windows sandboxing soon (probably). Be patient.
