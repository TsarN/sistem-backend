 To compile system one will need:
  - Patched Linux kernel (see ejudge.ru for sandbox patches)
  - C compiler
  - GNU C++ compiler (for several tests)
  - Free Pascal compiler (for unJudge17.pas)
  - GNU Make

 How to compile backend:
  - Go to "backend" directory
  - Compile system by typing "make"
  - Run tests by typing "make check"

 What to do if some tests don't pass:
  - Make sure that you are running on patched Linux kernel
  - (For *.cpp tests): make sure that /usr/lib/libc.so.6 and
    /usr/lib/libm.so.6 exist. If they don't symlink them
    with /lib/libc.so.6 and /lib/libm.so.6
    This is known issue with Linux ejudge patch
